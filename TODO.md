### Cruddy App Todo

#### Basic Improvments (requirements)

- [x] create individual items
- [x] delete individual items
- [x] edit individual items

##### Notes
- [x] Keep DOM and localStorage matching 
- [x] Remember event Delegation when adding new items to .show-text
- [x] make sure we do not duplicate data
- [x] add different values to the item

  ex.
```javascript
 item =  {
  id: "thing used for key",
  text-value: "some text",
  categories: [ 'cat1', 'cat2' ],
  isComplete: boolean,
  dateCreated: dateCreated,
  dateCompleted: dateCompleted
  ...
  etc
  }
```

#### Potential Libraries
- [ ] lodash/underscore
- [ ] jquery ui
- [x] bootstrap/material (css library)

#### My Spin
[x]Use Class helper function to create new Objs:)
[x]Incorporated a prompt for edits.
[x]Advanced delete button.
[x]Incorporate recursion.
